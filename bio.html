<br><br><br><br>
<div class="p_1"> &ensp;&ensp; Hello! My name is Zhonglin Hu, a master student major in Computer Science.
        My interest and pursuit of Computer Science stem from my study life through undergraduate and postgraduate.
        In the past year I was pursue for EE degree.
        However, the course I choose are related to Computer Science more or less, Algorithms(comp-160), operating system(comp-111) and Simulation of Bio-System(ee-131).
        After graduation from undergraduate school I choose to gap for half year to learn programming due to the visa, but more, to better make me realize what field I should choose.
        Through which I realized that in comparison with other subjects, it is Computer Science that drives forward the human society in recent decades.
        Especially now, with the pandemic of CoronoVirus, we all see the importance.
        No matter for the take-out App we use every day, or online-course software, the knowledge of Computer Science plays an indispensible role into it.
        If I could devote myself and make my contribution to facilitating the social development and making peopleâ€™s life easier,
        I believe that it will be meaningful for my life. </div>

    <div class="p_1">&ensp;&ensp; Due to my desire to further pursue my degree, I made several programs.
        For the basic like use Java to develop a chess game. Further more,
        I developed JavaWeb program for cell phone recycle, including database design, user login system, CSS/HTML to decorate the web page,
        customer web service and shopping trolley. Further more, I design a business journey website, and publish it with cloud service,
        http://123.56.56.43:8080/travel/ I also develop small programs at the platform Wechat(browser core).</div>

    <div class="p_1">&ensp;&ensp;
        All of those experiences have not only enabled me to practice and consolidate my professional knowledge,
        they have made me become a software engineer. Besides, I found that the genuine happiness from a program I built could be used in real life to help others.
        I really admire those engineers built IOS&Android App, our life will not get better without them, due to the situation now.
        I am eager to create powerful software on my own.</div>
